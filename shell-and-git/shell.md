## What are the terminal and the shell?

They are **text based user interfaces**. That means that you type commands to interact with the computer (create / move / delete / edit files, install software, change system settings...). <br>So in general it is a command interpreter that runs and executes commands on your computer and output results. <br>

## The concept - why are we using "Shell-Terminal"?

It is more prescise and faster. <br>For example: if i am co-working on a project file and i want one of my collegues to have look at a specific file or function, it is way more prescise to name the path instead of using a GUI, wich could misdirect him to the wrong file. So if we give the path thats leading to the data, there would be no misunderstanding.<br> <br> Other reasons/advantages are:

- Many tools don't have a GUI and can only be used as a CLI.
- You can write scripts (which consist of a number of commands) to automate processes and repetitive tasks and ensure they are being run exactly the same way every time they are executed.
